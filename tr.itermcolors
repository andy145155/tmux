 Day,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to update you that I’ve been reviewing the development process through the PR and repo Nick shared, which has given me a solid understanding of the Terraform module lifecycle across environments. This has been very helpful as I prepare to take on tasks.

I have two quick questions:

From your perspective, what are the most important areas or components I should focus on next to build a comprehensive understanding of the system?

Ringo mentioned that the team expects me to take on L3-level responsibilities after about six months. Could you please share what specific expectations or skills the team has for an L3 engineer? Understanding this will help me align my efforts accordingly.

Thanks so much for your guidance and support.

Best regards,
Andy

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to update you that after reviewing the PR and repo Nick shared, I now have a solid understanding of the Terraform module lifecycle across environments. With this foundation, I feel ready to start taking on tasks from today.
